# FlyAway
Phase2 Project

It is an online AirTicket booking application, where a user is prompted to input date of travel, source, destination and no.of seats to be booked. Based on the given date of travel, all the available flights for the specified date are shown. 
User can then selet any flight of interest, and is asked for personal information for registration. Later, a confirmation page is shown with all the details and is then proceeded for payment. 
If payment is successful, ticket purchase is done successfully.

There is also an Admin login page, where admin is prompted for username and password, then admin dashboard is displayed. 
Here admin can change password, view list of source and destination locations and available flights and available airlines and is also provided
an option to add or delete or update flight schedules.
